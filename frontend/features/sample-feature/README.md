# Feature Development Guide

This document outlines how to create and integrate new features into the application.

## Feature Structure

Each feature should follow this directory structure:

features/feature-name/
├── components/ # Feature-specific components
├── context/ # Feature-specific context (if needed)
├── pages/ # Feature pages
├── services/ # Feature-specific API services
├── routes.js # Route definitions for this feature
├── index.js # Main export that registers the feature
└── README.md # Documentation for the feature


## Creating a New Feature

1. Create a new directory in the `features` folder with your feature name
2. Implement your feature components, pages, and services
3. Create an `index.js` file that exports your feature configuration
4. Import and register your feature in `src/main.jsx`

## Feature Configuration

Your feature's `index.js` should export an object with the following structure:

javascript
const myFeature = {
name: 'feature-name',
routes: [
{
path: '/feature-path',
element: <FeaturePage />,
protected: true, // Set to true if the route requires authentication
}
],
navItems: [
{
label: 'Feature Name',
path: '/feature-path',
requiresAuth: true, // Set to true if the nav item should only be shown to authenticated users
}
],
};
export default myFeature;

```

This restructuring provides the foundation for a modular feature architecture. Each feature can now be developed independently while still integrating with the core application's authentication and routing systems.
